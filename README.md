Abstract---Endpoint anomaly detection is one facet of detective controls and a layer of defense that resides on systems that use and store data that attackers are after. Networks are the mode of transit component for data and the vectors over which attacks take place before they penetrate a host. As a result, modern Network Detection and Response (NDR) systems like DarkTrace and others must use many detection methods to effectively provide this, typically, initial layer of defense. Network focused anomaly detection is one of the methods for detection of malicious activities within an organization and machine learning plays a crucial role in advanced methods of such detection.
In this paper, I assess anomaly detection for network‑centric attacks using session‑level behavioral telemetry. I train Isolation Forest, Gradient‑Boosted Trees (GBT), and a Multi‑Layer Perceptron (MLP) against the binary attack_detected label under a forward‑in‑time split. At low false‑alarm operating points suitable for Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows, Gradient Boosting leads on the time-based test slice (Accuracy = 0.894; PD/TPR = 0.765; PFA/FPR = 0.0019). Of the supervised models, only Gradient Boosting satisfied the ≤1% FPR budget; the MLP exceeded it (1.19%). I position this result against current approaches and outline operational tuning for sustained low alert volume
